# My Web Technology Learning Path

## Introduction

ðŸŽ“ I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Science Engineering at Unibo.\
ðŸŒ± I am currently using Python and C++ but also interested in Web Development.\
ðŸŽ¯ My Goal is to learn the more I can about my passions: tech, economics, philosophy and psychology. But in this specific case my objective is to take trace of my      learning journey\
âœ¨ I like reading different types of content.

## Roadmap

This year (2023-2024) I've been introduced to **Web Technology course**.\
Here I want to reproduce all my *exercises* done as training in order to be prepared for the course it self.\
I will insert my personal and university **projects** done to test my comprehension and *my abilities. *
Durning the course my main goal is to realize some **static sites**, in order to improve my daily routines.\
By the end of the course I want to realize a well-formatted **site** to introduce myself and my background.

### Example Roadmap
1. HTML & CSS
2. JavaScript
3. Front-end Frameworks (e.g., React, Vue)
4. Back-end Development (e.g., Node.js, Python)
5. Databases (e.g., SQL, NoSQL)
6. Web Development Tools (e.g., Git, Webpack)
7. Web Security
8. Web Hosting and Deployment
9. API Development
10. Testing and Debugging
11. Responsive Design
12. Performance Optimization

## Final Note

I wholeheartedly believe that documenting my web technology learning journey and sharing it with others is a valuable and meaningful endeavor. This record of my progress isn't just a personal journal but a testament to the power of continuous learning and community engagement.

Learning web technology is a dynamic and ever-evolving process, and by maintaining this repository, I aim to achieve several important objectives:

1. **Accountability**: By making my learning path public, I hold myself accountable for my progress. It pushes me to consistently work towards my goals.

2. **Knowledge Sharing**: I understand the significance of a supportive and sharing community. As I learn and grow, I hope my journey can benefit and inspire others who are on similar paths or just starting out.

3. **Feedback and Improvement**: Constructive feedback is invaluable. Encouraging others to contribute and provide insights can help me enhance my understanding and skills.

4. **Showcasing Growth**: This repository is a testament to my dedication and how far I've come. It showcases the tangible results of my hard work and commitment to the craft of web technology.

So, I invite you to join me on this exciting journey as I explore the ever-expanding world of web technology. Your suggestions, feedback, and contributions are not only welcomed but encouraged. Together, we can foster an environment of shared knowledge and continuous improvement.

Thank you for being a part of my learning adventure!
