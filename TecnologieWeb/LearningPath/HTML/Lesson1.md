Hello! I'm excited to be your Web Technology teacher, and I'll be more than happy to guide you through the world of web technology, starting with the basics of HTML and progressing to advanced concepts.

**Lesson 1: Understanding HTML Basics**

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the foundation of web development. It's used to structure content on the web, making it both human-readable and machine-readable. Let's begin with some fundamental concepts:

1. **HTML Structure**: An HTML document consists of nested elements. It typically starts with `<!DOCTYPE html>`, followed by `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` sections. Here's a basic structure:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
       <title>Page Title</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <h1>My First HTML Page</h1>
       <p>Hello, World!</p>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

   - `<!DOCTYPE html>` defines the document type.
   - `<html>` is the root element.
   - `<head>` contains meta-information about the page.
   - `<body>` contains the visible content.

2. **Semantic Elements**: HTML5 introduced semantic elements, which add meaning to the structure of your page. This is important for accessibility and search engine optimization.

   - `<header>`: Represents the introductory content or a set of navigational links.
   - `<nav>`: Defines a section with navigation links.
   - `<main>`: Represents the main content of the document.
   - `<article>`: Represents a self-contained composition in a document, such as a blog post.
   - `<section>`: Represents a thematic grouping of content.
   - `<aside>`: Represents content that is tangentially related to the content around it.

Let's create a basic HTML document with some of these elements:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Semantic Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
                <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
                <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </header>
    <main>
        <section>
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm a web developer passionate about learning and sharing knowledge.</p>
        </section>
        <aside>
            <h3>Recent Posts</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#">The Basics of HTML</a></li>
                <li><a href="#">CSS Styling Tips</a></li>
            </ul>
        </aside>
    </main>
</body>
</html>
```

This code is semantically structured and uses various HTML5 elements to enhance the meaning of the content.
