**Lesson 2: Accessibility and WCAG 2.0**

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 is a set of guidelines to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. Here's how you can create accessible content:

1. **Page Title**: Always provide a descriptive and concise title using the `<title>` element.

2. **Headings**: Use heading elements `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc., in a hierarchical order. They help screen readers understand the structure of your content.

3. **Alternative Text for Images**: Use the `alt` attribute in `<img>` tags to describe the image's content for screen readers. 

4. **Semantic Elements**: As we discussed earlier, use semantic elements like `<nav>`, `<header>`, and `<main>` to provide a clear and meaningful structure.

5. **Keyboard Accessibility**: Ensure all interactive elements like links and forms can be navigated and used with a keyboard.

6. **Color Contrast**: Maintain good color contrast for text and background to aid readability.

7. **Descriptive Links**: Make link text descriptive and meaningful rather than generic "click here" links.

8. **Tables**: If you use tables for data, include appropriate table headers and captions to aid screen reader users.

Creating accessible content is vital for inclusivity, and it's also important for SEO.

**Exercise**: Try to enhance the provided HTML code to make it more accessible according to the principles we discussed.
